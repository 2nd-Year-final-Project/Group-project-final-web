# Course Management System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive course management system where:
- **Admins** can add courses, assign lecturers, and enroll students
- **Lecturers** can view their assigned courses and manage students (instead of hardcoded data)
- **Students** can view their enrolled courses with real-time data (instead of hardcoded data)

## Database Changes

### New Tables Created (`/database/course_management_updates.sql`)
1. **`courses`** - Stores course information
   - Fields: id, course_code, course_name, description, credits, difficulty_level, timestamps
   
2. **`lecturer_courses`** - Links lecturers to courses
   - Fields: id, lecturer_id, course_id, assigned_at
   - Foreign keys to users and courses tables
   
3. **`student_enrollments`** - Links students to courses
   - Fields: id, student_id, course_id, enrollment_date, status
   - Foreign keys to users and courses tables

### Sample Data
- Added 5 sample courses (Cyber Security, Data Structures, Web Development, Database Management, Software Engineering)

## Backend Changes

### New Controllers
1. **`/controllers/courseController.js`** - Complete CRUD operations for courses
   - `getAllCourses()` - Get all courses with stats

   - `getAllStudents()` - Get students for enrollment
   - `assignLecturerToCourse()` - Assign lecturer to course
   - `removeLecturerFromCourse()` - Remove lecturer assignment
   - `enrollStudentInCourse()` - Enroll student in course
   - `removeStudentFromCourse()` - Drop student from course
   - `getCourseAssignments()` - Get course lecturers and students

### Updated Controllers

2. **`/controllers/lecturerController.js`** - Enhanced with real data functions

4. **`/controllers/authController.js`** - Enhanced login response
   - Now returns `fullName` in addition to username and role

### Updated Routes

5. **`/routes/courseRoutes.js`** - New routes for course management
   - GET `/courses` - Get all courses
   - POST `/courses` - Add course
   - PUT `/courses/:id` - Update course

   - DELETE `/assign-lecturer` - Remove lecturer
   - POST `/enroll-student` - Enroll student
   - DELETE `/enroll-student` - Remove student
   - GET `/courses/:courseId/assignments` - Get course assignments

6. **`/routes/adminRoutes.js`** - Integrated course management routes
   - Added course management routes under admin prefix

7. **`/routes/lecturerRoutes.js`** - Enhanced with new endpoints
   - GET `/courses/:lecturerId` - Get lecturer courses
   - GET `/courses/:courseId/students` - Get course students

8. **`/routes/studentRoutes.js`** - Enhanced with new endpoints
   - GET `/courses/:studentId` - Get student courses
   - GET `/courses/:studentId/:courseId` - Get course details

## Frontend Changes

    - Real at-risk student identification
    - Enhanced marks entry with API integration
    - Personalized greeting with lecturer's real name
    - Real-time course statistics

12. **`/pages/StudentDashboard.tsx`** - Enhanced with real data
    - Fetches enrolled courses from API
    - Real course information and grades
    - Dynamic grade calculation
    - Loading states and error handling
    - Enhanced course details

13. **`/pages/Login.tsx`** - Enhanced to use full names
    - Now uses `fullName` from backend for better UX
    - Consistent across all user roles

## Key Features Implemented

### For Admins
- ✅ Add new courses with full details
- ✅ Edit and delete existing courses
- ✅ Assign multiple lecturers to courses
- ✅ Enroll multiple students in courses
- ✅ View course statistics (student count, lecturer count)
- ✅ Remove assignments and enrollments
- ✅ Real-time data updates

### For Lecturers
- ✅ View only assigned courses (no more hardcoded data)
- ✅ See actual enrolled students with real grades
- ✅ Calculate and display at-risk students based on performance
- ✅ Enter/update marks for students

-- Run /database/course_management_updates.sql
```

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create courses through admin interface
2. Assign lecturers to courses
3. Enroll students in courses
4. Login as lecturer to see assigned courses
5. Login as student to see enrolled courses
6. Test marks entry and grade calculations
