   - Updated student roster display to show both current and predicted grades
   - Added color coding: green for passing predictions, red for failing
   - Added prediction availability summary
   - Graceful handling when predictions are not available

3. **User Experience:**
   - Lecturers can now see AI predictions alongside current grades
   - Clear visual distinction between current and predicted performance
